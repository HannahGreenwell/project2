# Project#2: How Do You Doodle?

Skip the reading and go straight to a live version of the site here: [https://whichdoodle.herokuapp.com/](https://whichdoodle.herokuapp.com/)

### Description
An online, two-player drawing and guessing game (hmm... sounds a bit like Pictionary). One player is assigned the role of artist and can choose to either draw with the mouse or by simply wiggling their finger about in the air (if they are lucky enough to own a Leap Motion controller). The other player is assigned the role of guesser and can sit back and watch the drawer's sketch appear on their screen in real-time thanks to the magic of WebSockets. Once the excitement of the game is over, players can head to the gallery and check out their artworks.
